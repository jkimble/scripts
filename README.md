# scripts
A collection of scripts that I use for productivity. These scripts will work best with
[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com), but it's not required.

### Requirements:
**Scripts in the macOS directory will require macOS X 10 or higher.**

**If using Windows, WSL or Git Bash will be required to run shell scripts.**

## Example Commands
To run scripts manually:

### Get IP Address
```
./get-ip-address.sh
```
``` 
bash get-ip-address.sh
```
### Create a new email
Creates a new email using the default mail client.
```
./email.sh "recipient@mail.com" "Mail Subject" "Body Content"
```
```
bash email.sh "recipient@mail.com" "Mail Subject" "Body Content"
```

**recipient@mail.com** — Email address of the recipient.

**Mail Subject** — Subject line of the email.

**Body Content** — Content of the email body.
